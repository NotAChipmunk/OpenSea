# OpenSea
 Open source Sordie's Endless Augments
 
  This is far from complete currently it is just for testing client version detection.
  Copy files in \Release\Sea\ into your regular Sea folder.
  You don't need the msimg32.dll file if you already have Sea installed.
  This will force Sea to open it's console on startup and display what version of the client it thinks it's using.
  If fails to detect (aka "Unknown") feel free to contact me via discord or in game with the information it displays along with where you downloaded the client from.
  Thx.
