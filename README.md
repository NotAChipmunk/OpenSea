# OpenSea
 Open source Sordie's Endless Augments
 
  This is far from complete currently it is just for testing client version detection.
  Place \Release\Sea\Sea.Core.dll in your regular Sea folder (an optionally the VersionData folder).
  This will force Sea to open it's console on startup and display what version of the client it thinks it's using.
  If fails to detect (aka "Unknown") feel free to contact me via discord on in game with the information it displays along with where you downloaded the client from.
  Thx.
